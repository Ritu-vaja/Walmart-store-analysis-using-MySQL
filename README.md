# Walmart Store Analysis using MySQL

Welcome to the Walmart Store Analysis project, where MySQL is utilized as the database management system to conduct a detailed exploration of key business questions. This analysis prioritizes data integrity and accuracy before deriving actionable insights.

## Project Overview

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of Walmart store data, addressing key business questions such as maximum sales weeks, highest total sales year, and top-performing stores. The utilization of MySQL ensures a robust database management system for in-depth exploration.

## Dataset Information

The Walmart dataset, obtained from Kaggle, comprises a collection of data with over 6,000 rows. It provides detailed information about 45 Walmart stores, including weekly sales figures, holiday indicators, temperature records, fuel prices, and more.

You can access the dataset on Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/walmart-dataset).

## Key Business Questions Addressed

1. **Maximum Sales Weeks:**
   Identify the weeks with the highest sales, revealing the significance of Christmas and Thanksgiving as major shopping periods.

2. **Highest Total Sales Year:**
   Explore the total sales for each year, with 2011 standing out as a prosperous year for Walmart, contrasting with a relatively challenging 2012.

3. **Peak Sales Month in 2011:**
   Uncover the highest sales month in 2011, highlighting December as the peak sales period, aligning with the holiday season, and surprising observations in July.

4. **Top Performing Store:**
   Determine the store with the highest sales among the 45 Walmart stores, recognizing Store 20 as the top performer, closely followed by Stores 4 and 14.

5. **Stores with Highest/Lowest Growth Rate (2011-2012):**
   Analyze sales growth rates, indicating challenges faced by all stores, with Store 38 and 44 showing relative resilience, while Store 36 exhibited the highest decline.

6. **Sales Performance During Holidays:**
   Evaluate sales during holidays, with Thanksgiving, the Super Bowl, and Labour Day emerging as top performers, providing insights into customer spending patterns.

## Interactive Tableau Dashboard

Additionally, I have created an interactive Tableau dashboard to visualize key insights:

- **Sales by Year:** Explore the overall sales trends across all years in the dataset.
- **Sales by Store for All Years:** View sales distribution across different Walmart stores for each year.
- **Treemap for Each Store:** Analyze a treemap visualization for each store, depicting its sales for the selected year.

## Recommendations

In light of the analysis, here are strategic recommendations for Walmart:

- **Holiday Planning:**
  Implement strategic planning and promotional efforts during holiday weeks to capitalize on consistently higher sales.

- **2012 Sales Analysis:**
  Conduct a detailed analysis of factors contributing to the decline in 2012 sales for informed strategic planning and improvements.

- **January 2011 Sales:**
  Investigate causes behind the lowest sales in January 2011, such as post-holiday fatigue, and develop effective promotions for this period.

- **Store Expansion and Retention:**
  Capitalize on the success of Store 20 by focusing on customer retention strategies and replicating strengths in underperforming locations.

- **Growth Rate Analysis:**
  Investigate factors behind Store 38 performing relatively better than all other stores and replicate successful strategies in poorly performing stores like Store 36.

- **Targeted Marketing Strategies:**
  Develop targeted marketing strategies around holidays like Labour Day and the Super Bowl to boost sales, including tailored promotions and enhanced customer experiences.
